# Simple CSS-only 5 Star rating widget
My goal with this project is to demonstrate sibling conbinator selectors in CSS `~` allowing for custom radio button hover effects and the like. This widget uses no JS and has great compatibility with all major browsers.

### Useful resources
[Previous Sibling Selectors and how to fake them](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/how-to-make-the-impossible-possible-in-css-with-a-little-creativity-bd96bb42b29d)- Here is a great article on sibling selectors and how we can synthesize selecting previous sibling elements (instead of just after).
